# Prework Study Guide webpage

## Description

The study guide website provides an overview of key knowledge acquired in the course, connected to each of the key learning areas: HTML, Git, CSS and JavaScript. As the prework contains a lot of content, and covers new terms and concepts, it is important to have these documented in an accessible platform, for current and future students to access. The Study Guide also introduces a cartoon character 'Book Dog' who later becomes 'Code Dog.'
